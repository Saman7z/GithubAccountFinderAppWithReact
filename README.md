# I put a default github Account and that's mine, Sorry eh :)) ,
## And I tried it to be Responsive in at least adequate amount.
## The main reason i created this App was to resharpen my Skills on react and i decided to use **Diffrent Technologies**, In my case i used **react hooks context** and it was gr8.
